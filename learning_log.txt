1 December 2025: 
Goal for this week: run my first automated check. it is okay to go slow.

1. Dec 25: Day 1 complete:
 - Updated my LInkedIn headline to show I am learning automation
 - Created automation learning folder and learning log
 - Confirmed Python is installed and working
 - Finished in 10 minutes, faster than expected
 - feeling: this is too easy, I fear I will give up when it becomes hard. but I am proud that I have started. 
 - created the day1_extra file, with 3 examples of QA mindset checks.
 -Created roadmap textfile with journey details


 2. december: Day 2 complete:
 - Created day2_qa_logic with 3 test scenarios
 - translated manual test cases to automated day2_qa_logic
 - Learned: now all " are created equal, use comments instead if it breaks the code
 - Learned: spaces really matter, things outside the function will look wierd. How things show up, is dependent on how to is set up
 - Learned: I like it when things run smoothly, that's when I really get to work making things beautiful. 
 - Modified: got the test scenario 1 to look correct, but adding more spaces and setting it up cvorrectly. 
 - I ran each scenaroi indivially, instead of copy-paste-run
 - I modified the users, ion all the correct places, and could run it without problems
 - Learned: used a 25 minute timer, listend to my brains next signal
 Modification is a code skill in automation, I can read, understand and change test code
 feeling: exhausted, need a break, but I want to get the git problem to work today, after a short break 

 8. December 2025: Day 

[9 December 2025] - DAY # VICTORY!
- Learned proper test structure with assertions
- Debugged indentation issue: if __name__ must be outside functions
- Key insight: Python execution flow depeds on proper indentation
- feeling: Empowered by solving complex issues
